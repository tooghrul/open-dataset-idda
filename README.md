# OPEN DATASET - IDDA (TRANSPORT REVENUE)

# 📊 IDDA Open Data Visualization  
**Passenger Transport Revenue (Year-over-Year Change)**

## Overview

This repository focuses on data visualization using **IDDA’s open datasets**, with a specific emphasis on the transportation sector.

The selected dataset is:

> **“Nəqliyyat sektorunda sərnişin daşınmasından əldə olunan gəlir, əvvəlki ilə nisbə”**  
> *(Revenue from passenger transportation in the transport sector, year-over-year comparison)*

The goal of this project is to transform raw, publicly available data into **clear, interpretable, and meaningful visual insights** that highlight trends and changes over time.

## Dataset Description

- **Source:** IDDA Open Data Portal  
- **Domain:** Transportation / Economics  
- **Metric:** Revenue generated from passenger transportation  
- **Comparison Type:** Year-over-year change  

This dataset enables analysis of how passenger transport revenue evolves annually, making it useful for:
- Identifying growth or decline trends  
- Understanding economic or mobility-related shifts  
- Supporting data-driven discussions on transport policy and infrastructure  

---

## Project Goals

- Clean and preprocess open government data  
- Visualize year-over-year changes in passenger transport revenue  
- Present insights in a way that is easy to understand, even for non-technical audiences  
- Demonstrate practical use of open data for analytical and visualization purposes  

---

## Visualizations

The repository includes visualizations such as:
- Line charts showing revenue trends over time  
- Comparative views highlighting year-over-year changes  
- Clear labeling and scaling to avoid misleading interpretations  

Each visualization is designed with **clarity over complexity** as the main principle.

---

## Tools & Technologies

Depending on the implementation, the project may use:
- Python (pandas, matplotlib / seaborn)  
- Jupyter Notebook  
- CSV or similar open data formats  

The focus is not on flashy tooling, but on **correct data handling and honest visualization**.

---

## Why This Dataset?

Passenger transportation revenue is a strong indicator of:
- Public mobility patterns  
- Economic activity  
- Policy impact on transport systems  

Analyzing its year-over-year change provides more insight than raw values alone, as it highlights **direction and momentum**, not just magnitude.
